## Slots

| Name | Description  |
| ---  | ---  |
| [created_by](created_by.md) | The individual that created the entity. |
| [cross_references](cross_references.md) | Holds between an object and its CrossReferences. |
| [curie](curie.md) | A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI |
| [date_created](date_created.md) | The date on which an entity was created. This can be applied to nodes or edges. |
| [date_updated](date_updated.md) | Date on which an entity was last modified. |
| [db_date_created](db_date_created.md) | The date on which an entity was created in the Alliance database.  This is disinct from date_created, which represents the date when the entity was originally created (i.e. at the MOD for imported data). |
| [db_date_updated](db_date_updated.md) | Date on which an entity was last modified in the Alliance database.  This is disinct from date_updated, which represents the date when the entity was last modified and may predate import into the Alliance database. |
| [genomic_location_associations](genomic_location_associations.md) | None |
| [internal](internal.md) | Classifies the entity as private (for internal use) or not (for public use). |
| [obsolete](obsolete.md) | Entity is no longer current. |
| [secondary_identifiers](secondary_identifiers.md) | None |
| [taxon](taxon.md) | The taxon from which the biological entity derives. |
| [updated_by](updated_by.md) | The individual that last modified the entity. |
