# source_general_consequence

SOTerm (child of SO:0001576 - transcript_variant) that describes the consequence of the variant, as stated in the source reference when no transcript ID is provided. Since a curator would determine variant location and consequences relative to at least one specific genome assembly, transcript and/or polypeptide, no slot for curated general consequence is provided.
