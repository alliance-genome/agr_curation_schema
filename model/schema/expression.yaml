# QUESTIONS
# - HOW TO LIMIT CVTERMS ALLOWED IN XPRN - DID I USE THE RIGHT APPROACH?
# - OK TO JUST USE LIST OF CONDITIONS WITHOUT RELATIONS?
# - OH, MAYBE HAVE DIFF SLOTS FOR CONDITIONS (PER RELATION ALLOWED).
# - SHOULD 'CURIE' BE CHANGED TO 'ID' TO CONFORM TO STANDARD PRACTICE? Is this CURIE for Expression Class/Obj?
# - What if MODs do NOT have object IDs for Experiments or Expression annotations

  ExpressionAnnotation:
    is_a: AuditedObject
    description: >-
      A description of when and where gene products are observed to be present,
      including experimental details, supporting evidence, and curator notes.
    notes: >-
      Curators can provide several levels of evidence for an annotation, in an
      attempt to offer support the annotation schema at various MODs.
      A curator can provide a Figure within that reference (ZFIN).
      Also, a curator can provide an ImagePane within some Figure (MGI).
      It's unclear which of these approaches will be chosen for future Alliance
      expression curation.
    slots:

    slot_usage:
      associated_with_figure:
        description: >-
          The figure(s) that support(s) the expression annotation.
        notes: >-
          This can seem redundant with ExpressionAnnotationImagePane.
          But, sometimes we know the figure but don't have the image.
          Optional, as existing annotations from some MODs have no related
          images or figures.
        required: false
        multivalued: true

  TemporalContext:
    is_a: AuditedObject
    description: >-

  ExpressionAnnotationImagePane:
    is_a: Association
    notes: >-
      This aims to provide the same functionality as MGI imagepane.
      Some MODs (like ZFIN) point to the whole image. In these cases,
      the pane would encompass the whole image.
