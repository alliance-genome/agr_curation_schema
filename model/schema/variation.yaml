classes:
  Variant:
    is_a: GenomicEntity
    description: >-
      A DNA, RNA or protein/polypeptide sequence that differs relative to a
      designated reference sequence.  The sequence occurs at a single
      position or in a range of contiguous nucleotides or amino acids.

  VariantLocationAssociation:
    is_a: LocationAssociation
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Base class linking a variant to a position on a genomic entity and the resulting consequence to the sequence
      and/or function of that genomic entity. Slots are provided for data taken from a source publication or data
      load and for data resulting from manual curation. Where the values are the same, the curator has confirmed
      the information from the source.  In other cases, the curator's analysis has resulted in different values,
      for instance, if the assembly is different, the source did not specify the transcript or protein isoform,
      the definition of the transcript or protein isoform used by the source has changed, or if there was an error
      in the source data.
