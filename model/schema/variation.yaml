      designated reference sequence.  The sequence occurs at a single
      position or in a range of contiguous nucleotides or amino acids.

      load and for data resulting from manual curation. Where the values are the same, the curator has confirmed
      the information from the source.  In other cases, the curator's analysis has resulted in different values,
      for instance, if the assembly is different, the source did not specify the transcript or protein isoform,
      the definition of the transcript or protein isoform used by the source has changed, or if there was an error
      in the source data.
