  Gene:
    description: >-
      A DNA genomic entity from which one or more functional* RNA transcript molecules
      are transcribed, along with cis-regulatory elements responsible for regulating
      expression (transcription) of the gene. * A functional RNA molecule
      here can mean one that is directly responsible for the gene's function (e.g. catalysis,
      structure, etc.) or one that is translated to produce a functional polypeptide/protein.
      A pseudogene may be considered a gene under this definition, albeit no longer functional.
