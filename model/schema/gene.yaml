  Gene:
    description: >-
      A DNA genomic entity from which one or more functional* RNA transcript molecules
      are transcribed, along with cis-regulatory elements responsible for regulating
      expression (transcription) of the gene. * A functional RNA molecule
      here can mean one that is directly responsible for the gene's function (e.g. catalysis,
      structure, etc.) or one that is translated to produce a functional polypeptide/protein.
      A pseudogene may be considered a gene under this definition, albeit no longer functional.

  GeneCluster:
    description: >-
      A gene cluster is a set of genes which is of biological significance, and
      which is clustered together on the genome.

  FunctionalGeneSet:

  Operon:
    description: >-
      The DNA region of a group of adjacent genes whose transcription is
      coordinated on one or several mutually overlapping transcription
      units transcribed in the same direction and sharing at least one gene.

    range: SOTerm

  biological_entity_set_type:
    description: >-
      The type of BiologicalEntitySet.
    notes: >-
      We may choose to distinguish types of BiologicalEntitySet objects
      using this slot, rather than having different kinds of child objects
      like ParalogGeneSet, etc. This may depend on the extent to which different
      set types have distinct attributes.

  biological_entity_set_members:
    description: >-
      The list of members in a BiologicalEntitySet.
    notes: >-
      This is the simplest way to link members to the set. If additional
      metadata are needed to describe the association between the set and each
      member (e.g., evidence, type), we would need to model an Association
      object for each set-member association.
