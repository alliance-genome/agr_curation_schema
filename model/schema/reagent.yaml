        description: >-
          A unique identifier for the antibody: e.g., WBAntibody0000001.
        notes: >-
          As not all MODs have IDs (e.g., FB), some IDs will need to be minted
          at the Alliance.
          Does anyone use RRIDs as the 1o ID for antibody?
      name:
        description: >-
          Publicly displayed name of the antibody. It often includes the name
          of the antibody target: e.g., anti-WNT-4. It may also include the

          FB does not have names for antibodies, but would be easy to generate,
          so we may want to make this required.
