    slot_usage:
      curie:
        description: >-
          A unique identifier for the antibody: e.g., WBAntibody0000001.
        notes: >-
          As not all MODs have IDs (e.g., FB), some IDs will need to be minted
          at the Alliance.
          Does anyone use RRIDs as the 1o ID for antibody?
      name:
        description: >-
          Publicly displayed name of the antibody. It often includes the name
          of the antibody target: e.g., anti-WNT-4. It may also include the
          host species and antibody clonality.
        notes: >-
          FB does not have names for antibodies, but would be easy to generate,
          so we may want to make this required.
        required: true
      taxon:
        description: >-
          The species in which the antibody was raised: e.g., mouse, rabbit,
          guinea pig, goat, camel, etc.
        notes: >-
          FB does not have host taxon information for antibodies.
        required: false
      original_reference:
        description: >-
          The reference providing the original description of the antibody's
          generation.

  # If we need to have multiple paths to root class, then we can consider a mixin that allows

        description: >-
          A high level summary of the antibody intended for prominent display
          e.g., Antibodies against SEIP-1 were raised by injection of the
          peptide 261KKEEPGLLDLRKRK, corresponding to the C-terminus of SEIP-1,
          into rabbits.
