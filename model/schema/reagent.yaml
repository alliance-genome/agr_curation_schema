#      antibody_description:
#        description: >-
#          A high level summary of the antibody intended for prominent display
#          e.g., Antibodies against SEIP-1 were raised by injection of the
#          peptide 261KKEEPGLLDLRKRK, corresponding to the C-terminus of SEIP-1,
#          into rabbits.
#        notes: >-
#          Equivalent to WB summary.
#      antigen_description:
#        description: >-
#          A description about the antigen used to generate the antibody
#          e.g., N-terminal peptide (SQFRPEKKEKSTCSIC) full length ceKDM1A
#          (amino acids 1-897).
#      remark:
#        description: >-
#          Information pertaining to the antibody that is not covered by other
#          fields e.g., Possible pseudonym 7G1, High level of background,
#          Works well for immunoprecipitation.
#        notes: >-
#          Equivalent to WB remark.
