## CLASSES

classes:

# Do BiologicalEntitySets have unique identifier or unique name?
#   If not, do these sets have a set of identifying slots that determine uniqueness of the set.
# Metadata for Feature-BiologicalEntitySets relationship?
# Types of BiologicalEntitySets
# Attributes shared/specific to each type of BiologicalEntitySets.


  GeneCluster:
    description: >-
      A gene cluster is a set of genes which have a biological significance, and
      which are probably clustered together on the genome, like histones and miRNAs
    is_a: BiologicalEntity
    slots:
      - genes
      - related_note

  GeneCollection:
    description: >-
      A gene collection is a set of genes which have been grouped based on experimental evidence, for example a set of interacting genes, genes in expression cluster, or a set of ChIP binding peaks
    is_a: BiologicalEntity
    slots:
      - genes
      - related_note
      - experiment_type
      # maybe we want a slot for a GO evidence code here?

  Operon:
    description: >-

      coordinated on one or several mutually overlapping transcription
      units transcribed in the same direction and sharing at least one gene.
