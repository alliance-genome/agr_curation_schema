classes:

# Do BiologicalEntitySets have unique identifier or unique name?
#   If not, do these sets have a set of identifying slots that determine uniqueness of the set.
# Metadata for Feature-BiologicalEntitySets relationship?
# Types of BiologicalEntitySets
# Attributes shared/specific to each type of BiologicalEntitySets.
