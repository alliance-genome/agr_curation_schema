  CellLine:
    description: >-
      An immortalized or finite cell population that is derived from an organism
      and can be maintained in culture. Cell lines may be genetically modified,
      disease-derived, or established from normal tissue. This class represents
      cultured cell populations used in research, including embryonic stem cells,
      immortalized cell lines, and primary cell cultures.
