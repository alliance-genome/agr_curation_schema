    description: >-
      An entity representing a figure or table in a publication.
    notes: >-
      Ideally, a Figure entity represents an entire figure (or table). However,
      in some cases, a Figure entity may represent only a part of some figure.
      For example, when importing an old cropped image of Figure 2B, it may
      be simpler to simply create a Figure entity representing that 2B part.
      A Figure will usually have one related Image, but it can sometimes have
      many.

      Do we need a separate Image.label, or can it just use the label from the
      parent Figure entity?
