  SlotAnnotation:
    is_a: AuditedObject
    description: >-
      SlotAnnotation classes should be used when we need to attach metadata (in particular evidence and provenance)
      to a slot in the context of its referencing class, that can not be fully captured using an Association between
      the full class itself, and an InformationContentEntity. Evidence and provenance can exist here in the form of an
      evidence code, a publication, a personal communication or any other kind of InformationContentEntity.
      SlotAnnotation classes are used where the slot is not referencing a class in and of itself, and often has a
      scalar range.
    notes: >-
      A good example of the use of a SlotAnnotation class is the use case of attributing one of many functional
      impacts of an allele to a publication.  AlleleFunctionalImpact is the SlotAnnotation class that represents
      this use case.

      of the association, and likewise the object is the curie (or identifier of the class that is the object. The
