      the entity is internal (private).

  Note:

    description: >-
      Note object for capturing free-text describing some attribute of an entity,
      coupled with a 'note type', internal boolean, and an optional list of
      references. Permissible values for note_type can be viewed and managed in the
      A-Team curation UI Controlled Vocabulary Terms Table.

  SlotAnnotation:
    is_a: AuditedObject
    description: >-
      SlotAnnotation classes should be used when we need to attach metadata (in particular evidence and provenance)
      to a slot in the context of its referencing class, that can not be fully captured using an Association between
      the full class itself, and an InformationContentEntity. Evidence and provenance can exist here in the form of an
      evidence code, a publication, a personal communication or any other kind of InformationContentEntity.
      SlotAnnotation classes are used where the slot is not referencing a class in and of itself, and often has a 
      scalar range.
    notes: >-
      A good example of the use of a SlotAnnotation class is the use case of attributing one of many functional 
      impacts of an allele to a publication.  AlleleFunctionalImpact is the SlotAnnotation class that represents 
      this use case. 
    slots:
      - evidence
    slot_usage:
      evidence:
        required: true

  Association:
    is_a: AuditedObject
    description: >-
      A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence.  Associations have three base slots: subject, 
      object, and predicate, but they can have any number of additional attributes that help qualify the relationship 
      between the subject and the object.  The subject is the curie (or identifier) of the class that is the subject 
      of the association, and likewise the object is the curie (or identifier of the class that is the object. The 
      relationship between subject and object is defined by the predicate slot (which can also be constrained 
      using the range of the predicate).
